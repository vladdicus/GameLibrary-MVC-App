# GameLibrary-MVC-Application
An MVC application created for SPC's ASP.NET Programming with C# course. The purpose of this project is to give users a platform to share and explore video game reviews in an organized and interactive way. Users will be able to submit new games to the library/database, write their own reviews, or browse through existing titles to see what others have said about games they may be interested in.

### Week 10 README
This week I set up the core data model for the Game Library MVC project and got everything working with Entity Framework Core. The main goal was to make sure each game could store multiple reviews, which meant building two entities that actually connect in the database. I added a Game class with basic fields like Title, Platform, Genre, ReleaseDate, and Price. Then I created a Review class that ties back to a specific game through a GameId foreign key which also includes a rating, a comment, and the reviewer’s name.

In the ApplicationDbContext, I defined DbSet<Game> and DbSet<Review> and set up the one-to-many relationship in OnModelCreating. I also added cascade delete so removing a game automatically removes its reviews. After wiring up the connection string in appsettings.json and registering the context in Program.cs, I ran Add-Migration AddReviews and Update-Database. Both the Games and Reviews tables now appear in SQL Server Object Explorer.

These additions officially gives the project a working relational structure for future CRUD pages and data features. It also serves as the foundation for expanding the app to include more advanced functionality later on, such as filtering reviews, displaying average ratings, and managing user feedback more efficiently.

### Week 11 README
This week I worked on Separation of Concerns by moving non-UI logic into a dedicated service and wiring it up through dependency injection. The goal was to keep controllers focused on routing and responses while pushing the review logic (queries, averages, and inserts) into a reusable class. I created an IReviewService interface and a ReviewService implementation that handles three main tasks: getting the average rating for a game, getting the list of reviews for a specific game, and adding a new review with a basic rating check to make sure values stay between 1 and 5. I registered the service with a Scoped lifetime so it matches the DbContext’s scope and avoids unnecessary re-instantiation.

In GamesController, I injected the service and kept the actions fairly thin as per the assignment requirements. The Details action retrieves the game record and delegates all the review work to the service, then passes the results to the view through ViewBag. The AddReview action just collects inputs and calls the service to save the new review, then redirects back to the same page.

Overall, this structure made the project feel cleaner and more organized. Having a dedicated service keeps the logic consistent and makes it easier to expand on later, especially if I decide to add new features like sorting, filtering, or more advanced validation for reviews.

### WEEK 12 README
This week I added the CRUD feature to my Game Library application and completed one full vertical slice that focuses on the Games portion of the app. The main goal was to show a working list, detail, and one write action using asynchronous data access and validation feedback. To do this, I added a Create page that allows users to add new games to the database and an Index page that lists all the games that have been added. The Create form includes validation so users cannot submit invalid data, such as leaving the title blank or entering an invalid year.

In the backend, I updated my existing GameController to handle async operations using ToListAsync, FirstOrDefaultAsync, and SaveChangesAsync. This ensures that data access runs asynchronously and keeps the application responsive. The ReviewService continues to handle all review-related logic, while the GameController now manages game data directly using the ApplicationDbContext. This keeps the structure simple and easy to maintain while still following good separation of logic between controllers and services.

On the front end, I created two new Razor views called Index.cshtml and Create.cshtml. The Index page lists all games with an option to add a new one, and the Create page provides form validation to prevent invalid submissions. When a valid game is created, it saves asynchronously to the database and redirects the user back to the Index page to display the updated list of games.These updates show one complete vertical slice of functionality in the app that demonstrates async data access, validation feedback, and a working write action. All assignment requirements for this week have been met.
